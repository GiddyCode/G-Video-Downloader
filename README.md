## Why I Build It

In school we (students) had no wifi connection so we are forced to use our allowances to buy data and browse..
I actually built this just for the poor african students that dont regularly have access to wifii data, so they can have a copy of the course offline and not have to spend so much on data studing online....this is also (mainly) for those that got scolarships to study on plurasight where their subscription time and not unlimited...Keeping these things in mind I build this extension.

**there is no further development on this from my side**  Although, anyone willing to do any further development is free to do so. as i do not claim rights to this.
